# vagrant-node

vagrant-node is the virtual machine used for Node.js development.

## Installation

First of all you need to set up SSH agent forwarding for the key you use to authenticate with GitHub. Run

    $ ssh-add -l

and verify whether that key is listed. If so, everything is fine, if not, run the following command.

    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Next, you need to have [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and either VMware or VirtualBox installed. Once you have done this, you are ready to setup the virtual machine.

For that, first clone this repository. As the virtual machine will automatically provide all directories that share the same parent, you probably want to put it into a directory next to your projects' directories.

## Quick Start

To run the virtual machine, change to the directory you cloned into and run the following command.

    $ vagrant up

If you want to ssh into the virtual machine run the following command. Please note that insie of the virtual machine you will automatically be taken to the `~/projects` folder that contains all your projects.

    $ vagrant ssh

Apart from that, any other Vagrant command will work as well, such as `vagrant status`, `vagrant halt` or `vagrant destroy`.

### Verifying GitHub access

To verify that SSH agent forwarding was setup successfully, ssh into the virtual machine and run the following command.

    $ ssh -T git@github.com

If the output is

> Hi &lt;username&gt;! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

everything is fine. If not, please consider the documentation for SSH.

### Using Node.js

Inside of the virtual machine, Node.js has already been installed for you. Installation of Node.js is done using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), so you can easily switch versions if necessary.

Additionally, the following CLI tools have been installed globally and are ready to use:

- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
- [find-versions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/find-versions)
- [forany](https://github.com/thenativeweb/forany)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- [Harp](http://harpjs.com/)
- [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server)
- [knockat](https://github.com/thenativeweb/knockat)
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/)
- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)
- [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)
- [pm2-web](https://github.com/achingbrain/pm2-web)
- [reqd](https://github.com/thenativeweb/reqd)
- [UglifyJS2](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/)

Where necessary, port forwardings for these tools have already been configured.

### Using Docker

Besides Node.js, Docker has been installed as well. You can use it using the usual Docker commands such as `docker run` or `docker ps`.

If you add custom Docker containers, you may need to adjust the port forwarding settings in the `Vagrantfile` file and recreate the virtual machine from scratch. Please note that forwarding UDP ports requires some special actions. For details see the Vagrant documentation on [forwarding ports](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/forwarded_ports.html).

As we regularly use MongoDB and RabbitMQ, the ports `27017` and `28017` respectively `5672` and `15672` have already been setup for port forwarding, but both servers are not installed by default. We recommend using ready-made Docker images, such as [tutum/mongodb](https://github.com/tutumcloud/tutum-docker-mongodb) and [tutum/rabbitmq](https://github.com/tutumcloud/tutum-docker-rabbitmq).
